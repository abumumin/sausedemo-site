Note:

The filter was implemented to filter two conditions but it is important to note that the filter will only filter one condition at a time. The reason is that the filter is created in a select tag and select can only act on a single value or option at a time.

A better implementation would be to use a scenario outline to go through the two types of filter selected. Time constrain would not permit that.
